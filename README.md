# Moonshot Project

## What problem is my moonshot project solving
The field of physical profession is currently devoid of telework and my moonshot project aims at fixing this issue.  
My moonshot project will make it easier to work on different scales with a better vision, for example could help people to work on smaller things with a better point of view and better margins of error.  
It will also help to prevent Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) for any task with vibration for example.  


## Why do I think this problem is worth solving
In today's world, teleworking is common, but only in desk jobs. My moonshot project aims at enabling teleworking for physical profession and preventing WMSDs. It would also be interesting to touch at a lot of technologies that relate to IOTs such as low latency communication through the internet for example. I will also learn how to secure a connected device from attacks.

## How am I going to solve that problem
- I will build a software to record the headset's and controller's movement.
- The arm will be controlled by a raspberry and equiped by several servo-motors.
- Due to the power limitation the raspberry has, most of the calculation processing (such as how to move the motors as little as possible to reach the current controller position) will be done on the client's side then sent to the arm.
- I plan on using low level languages for the arm for a faster reaction time.
- I will use as little libraries as possible.
