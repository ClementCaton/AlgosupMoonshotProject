# Moonshot Project

## What problem is my moonshot project solving
As of today, the field of physical profession is devoid of telework and at risk of Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs).  
My moonshot project aims at fixing these issues by being able to be controlled from home and to prevent anything that could generate WMSDs to go in the real arm of the user.  
My moonshot project will also make it easier to work on different scales with a better vision, for example a smaller model of the arm can be created to help people to work on smaller things with a better point of view and a better margin of error.  

## Why do I think this problem is worth solving
In today's world, teleworking is common, but only in desk jobs. My moonshot project aims at enabling teleworking for physical profession and preventing WMSDs. It would also be interesting to touch at a lot of technologies that relate to IOTs such as low latency communication through the internet for example. I will also learn how to secure a connected device from attacks.

## How am I going to solve that problem
- I will build a software to record the headset's and controller's movement.
- The arm will be controlled by a raspberry and equiped by several servo-motors.
- Due to the power limitation the raspberry has, most of the calculation processing (such as how to move the motors as little as possible to reach the current controller position) will be done on the client's side then sent to the arm.
- I plan on using low level languages for the arm for a faster reaction time.
- I will use as little libraries as possible.
